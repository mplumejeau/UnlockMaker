 * A structure representing the card of a project, containing all the useful information it can contain
 * @var id : the unique id of the card (determined with the total number of cards, be careful when a card is deleted though)
 * @var type : the type/color of the card
 * @var number : the number of the card (almost always different from the id)
 * @var fixedNumber : an enable to indicate if the number of this card was chosen by the user
 * @var image : an enable to indicate if the card has an image associated with it in the project's folder
 * @var discard : the card's discard list, containing pointers to every card the player can discard when getting this one (discard = d√©fausse)
 * @var compatibility : a list containing every card that can be present in the game at the same time as this card
 * @var parents : a list containing pointers to every parent of this card
 * @var children : a list containing pointers to every child of this card
